----KNOWN BUGS----

- Landing the Epoch on the "wrong" tiles during the intro scene can cause the game to lock up. The music will stop playing, and you won't be able to enter anywhere on the map.

- Switching the party leader to a new character when coming in with a party of 2 will cause the game to behave weirdly. It is recommended that you move out of the room, then switch around characters.

- Occasionally, the transition from the whirpool out of Heckran Cave will lock up, often with parties using Crono. Generally, it's fixed by simply switching around party order before jumping in, or saving and loading.

- Some events that are activated by pressing A can break if you press it too fast. Try to be patient and avoid spamming buttons.

- The Enertron at Proto Dome acts weird for some teams. This is again mostly visual. Simply wait until the team regroups.

- Sometimes, ambient music that continues playing during fights resets after a fight.

- Having the randomizer in a folder path with a . generates seeds outside the folder with the . in its name.

- Falling off the waterfalls of Denadoro Mts can sometimes make the screen scroll down too far if you trigger the bird fight at the same time. This corrects itself when you open and close the menu.

- Saving a game on the 600 AD overworld immediately after exiting Denadoro Mts from the top makes the screen scroll weirdly upon reloading the save. Fixed by entering any location on the overworld.

- Occasionally, the music will restart abruptly after a fight, even if the fight itself didn't set any music.

- The Ioka Village trades for Fang and Feather and Horn and Feather are apparently bugged.

- Enemies will sometimes not display status messages if concurrent actions occur with other enemies or characters. Most visible with Lavos Core.
