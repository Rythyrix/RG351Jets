Basic Changes
-The player starts with the Epoch, and can travel to many sites around 600 and 1000 AD freely.

-Eras besides the two are locked, and require completing quests to unlock. Certain key spots, like Magus' Castle, are also locked.

-Characters who need to unlock magic now learn 3 techs before their Spekkio visit.

-All characters except Magus, Robo and Ayla have a standardized tech point distribution of 5->10->50 for their first three techs.

-Characters in general take a LOT less time to learn their techs than in vanilla. 

-Enemies are generally tweaked to support the progression. Yakra XIII and Retinite for instance are much more easier than they were in vanilla.

-Enemies in locations relevant to the progression give a lot more XP than in vanilla, and the gains grow bigger as you visit more in depth locations.

-Characters are slightly adjusted to fit the gameplay of the randomizer; characters who started with a speed of 6 now start with 8 speed instead, and Frog fits the role of a hybrid fighter/mage much better.

-Lavos was adjusted to not require high levels. Generally, levels around 30 or above should do, though equipment and tech combos play a big role.

-Power and Magic tabs now give random, usually stronger boosts, since both were quite underwhelming in the original game.
